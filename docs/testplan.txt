1.a. Adder 
1.b. negative
1.c. truncate
1.d. param_mult




1. Submodule testplan 

1.a. Adder 
Description
Addition unit that takes in two n bit numbers returns an n+1 bit number.
Concerns
inspired module is an n + n = n bit adder. need to understand over / under flow behaviour better. 
Testplan 
First, consider case where inputs are 8 bits. Constrain a to {127, -128, 0} and let b = {-128-127} --> see how / when it fails. 
Second, when important breaking edge cases are found, apply these for input bitwidth of 8,9,10,11,12

1.b. 
Description 
get the negative of a twos complement number
Concerns
limited, very small design 
what happens when you invert -128 --> ideally we get back 127.
Testplan 
Invert {-128, 127}

1.c.
Description 
truncate an n bit value (2cp) into an m bit number
Concerns
what is behaviour of truncating a positive number? floor(a/2^(n-m)) negative ceil(a/2^(n-m))
testplan
hit em with a constrained randomization.

1.d.
Description
Signed Multiplier 
Concerns 
It doesn't work! 
Testplan
work on a most simple case --> 4 bitwidth 3*2, -3*3 -2*-3
then: constrained randomization of inputs, get the outputs!
